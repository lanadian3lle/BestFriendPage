            <h1>Importance</h1>
            <p>Isn't it that almost everyone you meet has at least one best friend in their life? Someone we spend time with, someone who knows us better than others do, someone we can count on when the need arises. You have have heard the term, "A friend is a gift that we give ourselves." Yet, how much appreciation and time do we actually give them?</p>
            
            <p>The meaning of friendship. Some people have an easier time establishing nad maintaining friendships when they are compared to others. Everyone wants a relationship that is real and sturdy, but reality may not make it seem as though we could every have that dream come true. Maybe we can't find someone who meets all our needs and wants or you feel like that all your other friendships are ruined because of something you think you did. Don't get me wrong, it's ok to have expectations, but you have to be willilng to compromise. It's better to have a friend who is flawed, maybe you might not even see eye-to-eye sometimes, but thye are always there to catch you when you fall. What isn't ok is that you have all these expectations and whenever someone doesn't meet them, you get into a heated arguement and drop them our of your life. Life doesn't give us exactly what we want, in exactly the time and place we want it to happen. What life does is test your relationship,Isn't it that whenever we evaluate someone, whether it be a friend, collegue, or family, </p>
