            <p>As an extrovert who loves to meet new people. make new friends, socialize, and smile at strangers, I want everyone to feel wanted and included. When observing my surroundings, whether if I'm with friends or just staring off into space waiting, I see that there are more and more people who sit by themselves alone. They don't socialize, their heads are faced down, and they avoid any eye contact. They close themselves off from the world, as if they are physcially there, but they aren't actually there. </p>
