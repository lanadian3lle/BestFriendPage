            <div class="Title"><h1>Advice</h1></div>
            <div class="text"><p>Have you ever been in a sticky situation with a loved one or a friend? Don't you feel a mix of emotions whenever you and your best friend argue or disagree? Remorse, anger, hurt, betrayed, misunderstood, and annoyed? All these emotions are normal; we are all human and you can't just force yourself to stop feeling something. The main emotion that may be surfacing more than the others is nervousness. It is perfectly normal to feel scared and nervous when you and your best friend don't agree. It shows that you deeply care about them and you don't want to lose them; you don't want the relationship to crumble and end. Everyone feels this, but not very many try as hard as they can and work with their partner to solve the problem, which is something that we need to fix and get better at.</p></div>
            
            <div class="text"><p>Life doesn't give us exactly what we want, in exactly the time and way we want it to happen. Plans crash and ends don't meet 24/7. You need to try; both of you need to try to get to an understanding. Otherwise, if you don't try and do nothing, your relationship will stay the same. Trust me, friendships aren't easy and they are never always perfect. In fact, you should be grateful in a way when you and your partner get into some misunderstandings or fights.</p></div>
            
            <div class="text"><p>You may think, "Oh no! My best friend and I just had another fight/our first fight. I don't think that our relationship will ever be the same as before." Yes, that is right; your relationship will change, but not in the negative way that you may be thinking. As weird as it may sound, fighting actually can strengthen the relationship. It increases trust; now you both are more comfortable and less worried when another fight sparks, knowing that a fight won't immediately crush you both down. Knowing you can survive makes the fighting less threatening.</p></div>
            
            <div class="text"><p>Don't you feel so heavy and not in the mood when you have negative energy building up inside you and all you do is just hold it all in? The room may spin, you feel as if a thousand knives have been stabbed to your chest, and you feel like you're drowning? The best way to finally let those feelings out is to talk to your partner about it. Letting off steam and expressing how you feel releases the tension, fear, and anxiety. Your partner will be able to understand why you have been acting differently or distant around them. Communication is always the key.</p>
        
                <div class="text"><p>Fighting and misunderstandings tell us how important we are to our partner, as well as what is important to them. You will be able to know what they want, what they need, how compromising they are, how caring they are, their boundaries, and what will make them feel better. This creates more appreciation for each other. It also shows how they they feel about certian topics and how they think and act, which will be helpful in the future when something happens to the both of you, or when you need to help them out when they are stuck in a similar situation with someone else.</p></div>
            
            <div class="text"><p>After the situation, do you ever find yourself replaying the scene? How you acted and the words that you said? Self-evalutation is also one of the biggest things you can learn from fights and misunderstnadings. You would be able to recognize your weaknesses and strengths, which will help you when you and your partner have another fight. Do you give in to whatever they want? Do you stand up for yourself? Do you say things that you eventually regret saying? Do you shut down or do you explode? How patient and compromising are you? Do you focus on what's important and is willing to listen to what the other person has to say? Do you believe that your right all the time and that it becomes a battle of who wins and who loses? If you don't do this yet, try it. It will be able to help you figure out how to solve the arguement and it will also help you notice behaviors that you may have never noticed before when it comes to the way you act. This will help you become a better you, and it will help you and your partner bring back the peace in your life again.</p></div>
                
                
            <p>Remember that when you and your partner fight, you both need to remember that it's you two vs. the problem, not you vs. your partner.</p>
