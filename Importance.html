            <div class="Title"><h1>IThe Meaning of Friendship</h1></div>
            <p>Isn't it that almost everyone you meet has at least one best friend in their life? Someone we spend time with, someone who knows us better than others do, someone we can count on when the need arises. You have have heard the term, "A friend is a gift that we give ourselves." Yet, how much appreciation and time do we actually give them?</p>
            
            <p>Some people have an easier time establishing and maintaining friendships when they are compared to others. Everyone wants a relationship that is real and sturdy, but reality may not make it seem as though we could never have that dream come true. Maybe we can't find someone who meets all our needs and wants or you feel like that all your other friendships are ruined because of something you think you did. Don't get me wrong, it's ok to have expectations, but you have to be willing to compromise. It's better to have a friend who is flawed. Maybe you might not even see eye-to-eye sometimes, but they are always there to catch you when you fall. What isn't ok is that you have all these expectations and whenever someone doesn't meet them, you get into a heated arguement and drop them out of your life. If you haven't figured it out already, life isn't always fair. What life does is test your relationship. Life wants to see on how you will react to the situation. Don't give in to the trap, the trap that will ruin everything you worked so hard for. My most favorite quote is, "When you feel like giving up, think of why you held on in the first place." If you sacrificed so much and tried so hard to get to where you are right now, especially if that person is sacrificing and trying as much as you, don't ever let them go. Don't let all of the sacrifices you both have made go to waste, no one wins that way and all your efforts went down the drain. Just be patient; you will recieve what you want as long as you wait for it to happen.</p>
            
            <p>Friendships are very important in life that it is considered a neccesity. You need to have connections to be able to survive in this world. Without these connections, you are leading yourself into a locked room with absolutely no way out. Friends are there to encourage you and support you in your decisions. You need support, otherwise, who will cheer you on when you are at your lowest? Without anyone to turn to, who will be there to encourage you and push you to strive your best when you feel like you are giving up and can't go on anymore? Friends are there to help balance your time outside and indoors too. It isn't healthy to spend all your time moping around in your house. Friends have a way to push you out of your comfort zone. If you lock yourself in your room all the time, chances are that when you have at least one friend, they will suggest different activites that you both can do  outside while still having an exhilarating time.</p>
            
            <p>Maybe you want to make friends, but you are too introverted and shy to do so. It might seem awkward and nerve-wracking to go up to someone and start up a conversation. You may feel that you are unwanted and that because of how closed off you are from everyone else, no one will notice you even if you try. It is very understandable, especially for introverted people, that it takes such a harder and longer time for you to open up or just socially interact. But, if you do nothing, if you chicken out every time you are given the opportunity to do so, you will never get anywhere. All you will do is just stay in the same place for years, which isn't a very smart idea. Being around people who love and care for you will help you bring out your strengths and get over your weaknesses. They are there to help you become a better you, not destroy you and your life. There are people you have to be aware of, those two-faced people who pretend to be your friend, but lead you to the worst possible path behind your back. Not everyone is like that though; there are very few poeple out there who actually love you for who you truly are and love seeing you succeed. It feels good that not only your best friend is becoming stronger in life skills, but you were a part of that time in their life; you were there to watch them bloom.</p>
            
            <p>Have you ever had to keep something to yourself, good or bad, because you had no one to tell them to? Something you are really excited about has happened, something that you have been wanting for a long time, drama, or your stuck in a very difficult situation? Of course you need someone to talk to, someone to spill all your thoughts and feelings to. It isn't healthy in any way if you just keep all you are feeling to yourself, most especially the negative ones. You need someone to vent to, you need someone to talk and listen to what you have to say;that is exactly what friends are for. With friends, you can tell all your secrets, all your burdens, all your hopes and dreams. As long as you have someone that understands you, believes in you, accepts you, and comforts you, you will be able to get through all these tough times much easier. Without friends, life would be unbearable and boring. They are there to spice things up and make you feel more relaxed. We should never miss out on a chance when we are able to appreciate for their time, care, love, and friendship.</p>
