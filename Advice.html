            <h1>Advice</h1>
            <p>Have you ever been in a sticky situation with a loved one or a friend? Don't you feel a mix of emotions whenever you and your best friend? Remorse, anger, hurt, betrayed, misunderstood, and annoyed? All these emotions are normal; we are all human and you can't just force yourself to stop feeling something. The main emotion that may be surfacing more than the others is nervousness. It is perfectly normal to feel scared and nervous when you and your best friend don't agree. It shows that you deeply care about them and you don't want to lose them; you don't want the relationship to crumble and end. Everyone feels this, but not very many try as hard as they can and work with their partner to solve the problem, and that's ok.</p>
            
            <p>Life doesn't give us exactly what we want, in exactly the time and way we want it to happen. Plans crash and ends don't meet 24/7. You need to try, both of you need to try to get to an understanding. Otherwise, if you don't try and do nothing, your relationship will stay the same. Trust me, friendships aren't easy and they are never always perfect. In fact, you should be grateful in a way when you and your partner get into some misunderstandings or fights.</p>
