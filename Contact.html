            <div class="Title"><h1>The Story Behind the Story</h1></div>
            <div class="text"><p>As an extrovert who loves to meet new people. make new friends, and smile at strangers, I want everyone to feel wanted and included. I'm a high school girl who loves to socialize, sing, and act my heart out. I love seeing other people smile and I love giving advice and support to people who need help. Ever since I could remember, I was always known for helping others and being their shoulder to lean on. Depending on the situation, I may seem shy when I first meet people or I am totally energized and welcoming. Some people wonder and ask why I am being so nice and warm to others, even strangers and people who seemingly don't deserve to be given another chance by me. My goal is to bring people together; to bring more peace on Earth, which is why I have chosen being a clinical psychologist as my dream job. The world that we live in is so chaotic and there are many evil people out there. I'm hoping that if we treat them nicely, then slowly but surely their cold hearts will soften and they too will stop bringing discord into other people's lives. I believe that kindess is so powerful that it can move people and let them see that there is a better way to live life other than causing others pain and destruction. I want everyone to get along and feel wanted, since I know how it feels to not be wanted at all. The whole world turns against you and beats you down until you can't handle the pain anymore. This leads to depression, anxiety, and possibly even suicide. I absolutely won't let these extremely powerful, negative feelings devour anyone. I know there are millions of people suffering from these kinds of feelings, but I will do my very best to save as much people as I can. Everyone deserves a peaceful, joyous life filled with laughter and smiles.</p>
            <p>You were given a life because you are strong enough to live it. You aren't given anything that you can't handle, so don't lose hope and don't give up. If you feel that your good isn't good enough and that your best intentions just make a mess of things, remember that giving up is the only sure way to fail. You can't avoid failure/falling down. When you look back into the past, you will realize that failure and the fear of failure isn't what matters. It is the courage to continue that counts. Everything you want is on the other side of fear and the obstacles that come with it. Don't let uncertainty hold you a prisoner. Take the leap; you decide if you want to remain a coward for the rest of your life or be proud of how far you have come and that you finally reached your dreams after taking the risk. </p></div>
