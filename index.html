            <h1>Best Friends For Life</h1>
            <p>Have you ever found someone? Someone who is one of your favorite people in the world? Someone who you're pretty sure she/he is you soulmate but in a friend way? The person who will be there through all your achievements, heartbreaks, bad decisons, life outcomes, and just someone who never left you when they were given a million chances to? If you are those lucky people who found someone who will help you grow to the person you have always dreamed of being, don't ever take them for granted.</p>
            <p>I am very lucky to have my best friend forever, Lyan Dela Cruz. She was, and still is, always there for me ever since the day we met, the first day of 2nd grade. Right when I saw her, even though we were instictively nervous and a bit shy, we clicked. Ever since then, we were, and still are, very inseparable despite the 750.1 miles that may challenge Lyan's and my friendship.</p>
            <p>4th grade was the last time I was able to actually spend some quality time with Lyan, since my family and I had to move from San Diego, California to Salt Lake City, Utah. One of the things I was very afraid of was that when I moved, everyone would forget about me and all of my friends and I would disconnect. Eventually, all of my friends and I stopped talking for no reason. What surprised, yet at the same time didn't surprise me, was that Lyan was the only person that still constantly kept in touch. We would try to break the barrier by our daily texts, video chats, and by social media. For almost 5 years and counting, we never let distance stand in our way.</p>
            <p>Trust me, long-distance relationships are one of the hardest things I have ever had to deal with. It was easier when Lyan and I were in the same school, linking arms and alwys having each others back no matter what. We are able to physically comfort each other when we were going through very hard times in our personal lives, and in the very rare misunderstandings we had. Even though we text everyday and spill the tea, we aren't physically there to see how the exact situation is to better understand what the other person is exactly going through. But, that has never stopped us from being there for each other.</p>
            <p>Ever since the beginning, Lyan and I have always understood each other to the point that no one else could every understnad us; it is as if we were actually twins (which is what we think of each other). In our daily routine of texting and just telling each other problems and how our day went after 7 years in total, to this day we are surprised that we go through almost the exact situations; it is as if the universe is giving us all these situations at the same time for us to have someone who can truly understand what we are going through, someone who can truly relate.</p>
            <p>  She is one of the most important people in my life, she is one of my sources of happiness. We always look to each other for support, advice, comfort, and someone who will listen to us. She accepts me at my worst, and maes me feel loved and gorgeous at my best. Shw knows exactly what to say to calm me down, or at least make me feel better.</p>

            <h1>Why I love Lyan</h1>
            <p>Lyan and I understand each other to a level that no one could ever reach, and we know each other's life story so well that we could even write a biography of each other. None of my other friends could ever compare to Lyan and certainly no one could ever replace her. Sometimes she forgets how amazingly wonderful she is, so Lyan if you are reading this, I want you to remember some of the reasons why I love you. I love you because:</p>
