            <h1>Advice</h1>
            <p>Have you ever been in a sticky situation with a loved one or a friend? Don't you feel a mix of emotions whenever you and your best friend? Remorse, anger, hurt, betrayed, misunderstood, and annoyed? All these emotions are normal; we are all human and you can't just force yourself to stop feeling something. The main emotion that may be surfacing more than the others is nervousness. It is perfectly normal to feel scared and nervous when you and your best friend don't agree. It shows that you deeply care about them and you don't want to lose them; you don't want the relationship to crumble and end. Everyone feels this, but not very many try as hard as they can and work with their partner to solve the problem, and that's ok.</p>
            
            <p>Life doesn't give us exactly what we want, in exactly the time and way we want it to happen. Plans crash and ends don't meet 24/7. You need to try, both of you need to try to get to an understanding. Otherwise, if you don't try and do nothing, your relationship will stay the same. Trust me, friendships aren't easy and they are never always perfect. In fact, you should be grateful in a way when you and your partner get into some misunderstandings or fights.</p>
            
            <p>You may think, "Oh no! My best friend and I just had another fight/our first fight. I don't think that our relationship will ever be the same as before." Yes, that is right; your relationship will change, bu tnot in the negative way that you may be thinking. As weird as it may sound, fighting actually can strengthen the relationship. It increases trust; now you both are more comfortable and less worried when another fight sparks, knowing that a fight won't immediately crush you both down. </p>
        
            <p>It's completely normal if you and your partner don't always do, want, or love the same things. When we become comfortable in a relationship, it is easy to think that our best friends immediately knows how we feel, our needs, and our wants. We assume that because of how close you are to each other, you both have developed ESP. We might get frustrated that no matter how many hints you throw at them, no matter how unormal you are acting rather than being your usual self, they may not</p>
